	<h1> Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
	<p>Working with a partner we expiremented with basic Javascript data types and variables.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>One of the Challenges I faced with this lab was when I wrote down the document.writeln() I forgot some parenthesis.
	The CSS was not changing the script color for some reason as it had been linked to the lab css, but it did not work.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p> The results of the lab are in this index.html file which I created. Here is the program execution that was made.</p>
	<div>
        <h2>Script Output</h2>
