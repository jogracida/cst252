<body><h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
	<p>The idea of this lab was to work with our partner, experiment with basic Javascript data types and variables.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>One of the Challenges I faced with this lab was making sure I used the space after writing down a word for example if I had done.
	make I would have to do a space and equal sign. Keeping on repeating this was also challenging as it takes some time to remember. Also
	when I wrote down the document.writeln() the many quotations confused me.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p> The results of the lab are in this index.html file which I created. Here is the program execution that was made.</p>
