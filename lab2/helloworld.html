		<h1>Hello  World!</h1>
	<p>My name is Jonathan, but you can call me Johnny, I am a third year communication
	design major and a cinematic arts and technology minor. I aspire to be able to graduate CSUMB
	and acquire a job out of college working as a video editor or a career in graphic design.
	</p>
	<p> Heyo! I'm Eduardo Aleman, but you may refer to me as Eddie! I'm a junior here at CSUMB, with a major in Communication Design.
			My concentration though is Game Design! I love to play video games, jam out to music, and hang out with my friends and goof around. I used to play Volleyball, Golf, and Soccer.
			I hope to play again when this Pandemic is over with. A couple things I did during the summer of the pandemic was build my first PC, got a new desk, and met amazing people online!
			This is my second round of a web desgining class! I'm more scared due to it being Javascript focused, and it looks very intimidating without the knowledge of how it works.
