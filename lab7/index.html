	<h1> Lab 7: Functions </h1>
	<p>Working with a partner we expiremented with basic Javascript and functions that take user input.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>One of the Challenges I faced with this lab was when trying to change the script text color to be white.</p>
  I managed to make a div id for my script. 
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p> The results of the lab are in this index.html file which I created. Here is the program execution that was made.</p>
	<div>
    <div id="output">
        <h2>Script Output</h2>
        <script class="text" src="js/lab7.js"></script>
    </div>
	</body>
