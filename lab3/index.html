	<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
<p>The idea of this lab was to create a local file structure and make more folders as well as an index.html file.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>One of the Challenges I faced with this lab was making the image for my homepage go down in width and height. For some reason
	it didn't want to work with width being auto and height being 50%, but as soon as I changed both to 50% and made it an ID it worked.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p> The results of the lab are in this index.html file which I created. Here is the file structure that was made.</p>
