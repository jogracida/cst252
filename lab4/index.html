<body><h1>Lab 4 Psuedocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
	<p>The idea of this lab was to create a psuedocode and do some problem solving as well as make an index.html file.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>One of the Challenges I faced with this lab was making the psuedocode from scratch and coding with the using the pre and code tags.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p> The results of the lab are in this index.html file which I created. Here is the file structure that was made.</p>
<p><pre><code>	// Create a 8x8 board
	  // Black and red squares
	    // Every other square is red
	      // Define player pieces
	        // Take user input
	          // Authenticate user input
	            //Take AI/Player input
	              // Validate
	                // check win condition
	        // If no win, reset to step 5
				</pre></code></p>
